## Status of Fine Particulate Matter in Seoul (2021)

## 1. 대기오염측정망
|  서울시는 대기오염예경보제 운영과 대기오염실태 파악 및 대기질 개선대책 수립에 필요한 기초자료를 확보하기 위하여 대기오염측정망을 설치, 운영하고 있다. 대기오염측정망은 도시대기측정망, 도로변측정망 등을 운영하고 있다.

*  **도시대기 측정망**: 인구밀집지역의 대기오염도 및 환경기준 달성여부를 파악하여 대기질 개선 및 환경시책에 활용할 목적으로 운영하는 측정망으로 서울시 각 구별 1개소씩 총 25개의 측정소가 있다.

* **도로변 측정망**: 자동차 통행량과 유동인구가 많은 도로변의 대기질 파악을 목적으로 15개의 도로변 측정소를 운영하고 있다.

|  Research Institute of Public Health and Environment of Seoul Metropolitan Goverment operates a network of air monitoring stations that measure fine particulate matter and other air pollutants. This indicator reports on the concentration of fine particulate matter from 2004-2020 and compares it to the South Korea Air Quality Standards established by Ministers of the Environment.

####

* **Fine particulate matter**: Solid or liquid particles floating in the air are called particluate matter. The smallest of these particles(those that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter, or less than 1/20th the width of a human hair) are called fine particluate matter(PM2.5). Fine particluate matter comes from many natural and huamn activites, includeing wildfires and emission from prescribed burning, forestry operations, residential woodstoves, and transportation.

* **Be Harmful to humans**: Exposure to fine particlulate matter has been associated with several serious health effects including heart and lug disease. Both shor-term(24-hour) and longer-term(a year or more) exposure to fine particluate matter can have negative effects on human health.

### **Fine Particluate Matter(PM2.5)**: South Korea Ambient Air Quality Stnadard
|National ambient air quality Standard|Level|
|:---:|:---|
|Yearly|15ug/m3 or less|
|24-hour|35ug/m3 or less|


The map below summarises South Korea Ambient Air Quality Standard achievement status for fine particluate matter in Seoul. air zones, as well as both the annual and 24-hour PM2.5 levels at individual monitoring stations. Summaries are given for each monitoring station where sufficient data was available for the reporting period.
